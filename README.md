# Todo React App

# Author: Eduardo Mejia

# This is React todo app that writes a list of task to accomplish.

# The following components make up the app:

1.  Header
2.  Todoform
3.  Todolist
4.  Footer

# and the following files are used to style the markup:

1.  App.css
2.  Todo.css
3.  Todoform.css

# The app uses a Universally Unique Identifier or UUID function to create unique IDs for mapping the list.
