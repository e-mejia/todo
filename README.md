# Todo React App

Author: Eduardo Mejia

This is a React "todo" app that creates a list of tasks to accomplish

The following components make up the app:

1.  Header
2.  Todoform
3.  Todolist
4.  Footer

and the following files are used to style the markup:

1.  App.css
2.  Todo.css
3.  Todoform.css

The app also uses React hooks, useState, useEffect and useRef.

The app uses a Universally Unique Identifier or UUID function to create unique IDs for mapping the list.
